 Game made in GML

Most of the interesting code can be found in the scripts and objects folder. Due to the game being made in the GameMaker Studio engine, all the files (except the scripts) will include GameMaker jargon which hasn't been coded by me. The real code in these files can be found between the "<string> / </string>" lines.
